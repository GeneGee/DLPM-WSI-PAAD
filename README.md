# DLPM-WSI-PAAD
Purpose: In this program, I want to build a Deep Learning Prognostic Model based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) from TCGA-PAAD.\nDataset: I download TCGA-PAAD dataset from cbioportal, https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=paad_tcga. Then, take use of Algorithm: CLAM, https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM, for segmentation, patching, feature extraction, and model training, evaluation, and attention heatmap for ROI.
